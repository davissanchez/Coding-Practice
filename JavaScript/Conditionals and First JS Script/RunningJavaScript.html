    <h1>First JS Script</h1>
    <p>
      This HTML file is basically just a vessel to carry our JavaScript for now.
      For now, the JS written won't interact with the elements.
    </p>
    <p><b>Look at the console to see what we've done in the JS file.</b></p>
    <script src="RunningJavaScript.js"></script>
    <!-- we put the scripe element at the end of the body so that all the elements can be loaded up before we run the javascript on them, doesn't matter here bc nothing we are doing is interacting with elements but just so y'all know -->
  </body>
